# CheckIO - Home Challenge 4 : The Most Wanted Letter
# http://checkio.org

# You are given a text, which contains different english letters
# and punctuation symbols.
# You should find the most frequent letter in the text.
# The letter returned must be in lower case.
# While checking for the most wanted letter, casing does not matter,
# so for the purpose of your search, "A" == "a".
# Make sure you do not count punctuation symbols, digits and whitespaces,
# only letters.
# If you have two or more letters with the same frequency, then
# return the letter which comes first in the latin alphabet.
# For example -- "one" contains "o", "n", "e" only once for each,
# thus we choose "e".
# Input: A text for analysis as a string (unicode for py2.7).
# Output: The most frequent letter in lower case as a string.
# Precondition: The password contains only ASCII symbols. 0 < len(text) â‰¤ 105
